### Activities

Key development activities in OpenInfra Labs include:

- Operate First: making cloud operations as fundamental as functionality in the upstreams. 
[Read the Operate First Community Manifesto](/operate-first-community-manifesto/).

- Project Caerus: improving coordination between compute and storage systems for big data and AI workloads. 
[Read the Project Caerus Manifesto](https://gitlab.com/open-infrastructure-labs/caerus/-/blob/master/Manifesto.pdf).

- Elastic Secure Infrastructure: enabling infrastructure to be securely provisioned and moved between different services. 
[Visit the ESI project page](https://www.bu.edu/rhcollab/projects/esi/)
